'''
Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following operations: add and find.

add - Add the number to an internal data structure.
find - Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value.

For example,
add(1); add(3); add(5);
find(4) -> true
find(7) -> false
