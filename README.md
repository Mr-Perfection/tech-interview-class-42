# tech-interview-class-42
Interview prep. class taught at 42 by students (not associated with 42 school).

### Objective
Help 42 students to ace the technical interviews & strengthen network of motivated students to help each other to succeed in tech career. 

### Format
Students will be solving problems within time limit (depending on difficulties), and organzier will go over the solutions in details. If students are able to solve the problem, they will explain to other students how their approaches are and make them understand.

### Meeting every Tuesday and Thursday from 7:00pm to 8:30pm (TBD).




### How to approach the tech interview questions?
1. Read the question that interviewer asked you and ask for any clarifications.
2. If you have any assumptions, don't just assume them. Ask if your assumptions are correct.
3. Once you get the example input or output from the interviewer, try to find a pattern.
4. Speaking of pattern, what I meant is which data structures or algorithms you can use to solve this challenging problem.
5. Think hard (3-10 minutes).
6. Can't think of the most efficient way, start from bruteforce (6-10 minutes).
7. If you can think of more efficient approaches, awesome! (10-20 minutes)
8. Communication is the key. Always communicate how your thought process is. 
   Interviewer will guide you to the right path if you are way off.

### How can I improve?
* Do a ton of questions. You will start seeing some sort of patterns how you can tackle those problems.
* Do more tech interviews.
